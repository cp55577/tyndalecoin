## About William Tyndale

William Tyndale (c. 1494–1536) was an English scholar who became a leading figure in Protestant reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible into English. Tyndale was determined to make the Scriptures accessible to ordinary people, defying the authorities of his day who wanted to keep the Bible in Latin.

Despite facing persecution, imprisonment, and ultimately execution, Tyndale completed translations of the New Testament and significant portions of the Old Testament. His work became the foundation for the King James Version and many subsequent English translations.
