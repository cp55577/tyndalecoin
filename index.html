                <h2>About William Tyndale</h2>
                <p>
                    William Tyndale (c. 1494–1536) was an English scholar who became a leading figure in Protestant 
                    reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible 
                    into English. Tyndale was determined to make the Scriptures accessible to ordinary people, defying 
                    the authorities of his day who wanted to keep the Bible in Latin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite facing persecution, imprisonment, and ultimately execution, Tyndale completed translations 
                    of the New Testament and significant portions of the Old Testament. His work became the foundation 
                    for the King James Version and many subsequent English translations. Tyndale's last words before 
                    being strangled and burned at the stake were: "Lord, open the King of England's eyes!"
                </p>

                            Bridge is a free way to explore the Christian faith in a relaxed, non-threatening environment 
                            over ten weeks. The talks are designed to raise important questions and inspire conversation. 
                            Generally 30 minutes long, they seek to answer important questions like: Why does God allow 
                            suffering? Is Jesus the only way? Is Christianity really worth it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After this, there's a 30 minute discussion to interact with the talk and share your perspective. 
                            It's a safe environment where you can ask whatever question you like or not say a word. No one 
                            will ever call on you. Doubters are welcome.
