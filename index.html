                <h2>About William Tyndale</h2>
                <p>
                    William Tyndale (c. 1494–1536) was an English scholar who became a leading figure in Protestant 
                    reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible 
                    into English. Tyndale was determined to make the Scriptures accessible to ordinary people, defying 
                    the authorities of his day who wanted to keep the Bible in Latin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite facing persecution, imprisonment, and ultimately execution, Tyndale completed translations 
                    of the New Testament and significant portions of the Old Testament. His work became the foundation 
                    for the King James Version and many subsequent English translations. Tyndale's last words before 
                    being strangled and burned at the stake were: "Lord, open the King of England's eyes!"
                </p>
